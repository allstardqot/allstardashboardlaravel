            <h4>POOLS – FORMATS, REGISTRATION AND WINNERS</h4>
            <p>As part of its services, the Platform may make available the Pools on the Platform.</p>
            <p>Currently, the Platform hosts Pools in respect of a fantasy football game. Users wishing to participate in such Pools, are permitted to create their own fantasy teams (“Teams”), consisting of seven real life footballers involved in the real-life football match (as applicable), series or tournament (each a "Sport Event") to which the fantasy game relates.</p>
            <p>
            Teams are awarded points on the basis of the real-life footballers' performances at the end of a designated match or tournament of the Pools. The User(s) whose Team(s) have achieved the highest aggregate score(s) in the Pool(s) shall be declared winners ("Winners"), with such Winners being entitled to seventy-five percent (75%) of the entire prize pool amount, and the Users whose Teams have achieved the second highest aggregate score in the Pools being declared (“First Runners-Up”) and being entitled to ten percent (10%) of the entire prize pool amount.
            </p>
            <p>The Platform adheres to a daily fantasy sports format wherein Users shall compete in weekly league challenges (the "Game Week") for each week of a particular league season. In each Game Week, Users will either create or join customizable tournaments ("Pools"). Each Pool can be either:</p>
            <p>a.	Public - Any User can join up to the maximum number of allowed Users in the Pool.</p>
             <p>b.	Private - Users can only join through an invitation from the creator of the Pool.</p>   
             <p> User may participate in a public Pool by paying a pre-designated fee, as stipulated on the respective page of the Pool by the respective public Pool’s admin. For participation within a private Pool, each User must pay a pre-designated fee as well be in possession of a specialised password to access such a private Pool. Such ‘pre-designated’ fee is the User’s contribution towards prize money pool and includes a pre-determined transaction fee for the User’s access of the Platform’s services. </p>
             <p>Users must choose only one of the teams they create to compete in each designated Pool. At the end of each Game week, the teams will be deleted, and the User shall go through the game cycle again.</p>
             <p>In order to register for the Pool(s), Users are required to:</p>
              <p>a.	Have previously registered on the Platform as a User;</p>
              <p>b.	Have created a Team on the Platform</p>
              <p>c.	Have sufficient Allstars Fantasy Coins (“AFC”) to buy into the Pool (in accordance with Clause 10.5. herewith)</p>
              <p>Participants are also required to confirm that they have read, and shall abide by, these Terms and Conditions.</p>
              <p>The results and winners of each pool offered through and organised on the Platform will be final. The determination of the results and winners of each pool shall be in accordance with the specific provisions of the pool as well as in accordance with the Platform’s whitepaper (‘Platform Whitepaper’). By registering and/ or participating in any public or private Pool, you agree to be bound by these determinations.</p>
              <h4>SKILL GAME; NON-GAMBLING</h4>
              <p>Each User acknowledges that the outcome of the pools offered on the Platform is directly related to the skill levels of each person participating. The Company does not comment or have knowledge of the probability of one User winning a pool and makes no representations about an individual’s chances of winning. </p>
              <p>No gambling is allowed within the Platform.</p>
